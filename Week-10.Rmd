# Week 10 (Oct 10)

This week, you will finish your individual research, reading about the
specific topic for your final project. Remember that you should focus on
finding resources that help you understand the methodological topic you
are working with. /

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following
questions:

1.  Provide a summary of each article or source in your individual
    literature review. Include proper citation of the article for your
    bibliography. You must include summaries of at least 5 resources for
    full credit.

2.  What questions, if any, do you have?

You will receive feedback on your submitted literature review before
next week's first class meeting.
